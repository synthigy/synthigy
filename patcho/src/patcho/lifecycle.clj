(ns patcho.lifecycle
  "Module lifecycle management with dependency resolution.

  Provides runtime lifecycle management for modules with explicit dependency
  declaration and automatic startup ordering.

  ## Design Philosophy

  This namespace provides a lightweight registry for managing module lifecycle:
  - Modules register themselves at namespace load time
  - Dependencies are declared explicitly
  - Operations are RECURSIVE - automatically handle dependencies
  - Cleanup uses reference counting (claimed-by semantics)
  - State tracking prevents double-start/stop
  - Setup phase is separate from start/stop (one-time vs runtime)

  ## Usage

  ### Registration (at namespace load time)

      (ns my.module
        (:require [patcho.lifecycle :as lifecycle]))

      (lifecycle/register-module! :my/module
        {:depends-on [:other/module]
         :setup (fn []
                  (create-tables!))
         :cleanup (fn []
                    (drop-tables!))
         :start (fn []
                  (start-connections!)
                  (subscribe-to-events!))
         :stop (fn []
                 (unsubscribe!)
                 (close-connections!))})

  ### Application Startup

      (ns my.app
        (:require
          my.database      ; Registers :my/database
          my.cache         ; Registers :my/cache (depends on :my/database)
          my.api           ; Registers :my/api (depends on :my/cache)
          [patcho.lifecycle :as lifecycle]))

      ;; Set default store once (typically in main or init)
      (lifecycle/set-store! (lifecycle/->FileLifecycleStore \".lifecycle\"))

      ;; Simple approach: Just start! (auto-runs setup if needed)
      (lifecycle/start! :my/api)
      ;; → Setups (if needed) and starts: :my/database → :my/cache → :my/api
      ;; Setup is idempotent - only runs once, tracked via lifecycle store

      ;; OR explicit control: Run setup separately (optional)
      (lifecycle/setup! :my/api)  ; One-time: setup all dependencies
      (lifecycle/start! :my/api)  ; Runtime: start all dependencies

      ;; Visualize dependencies
      (lifecycle/print-dependency-tree :my/api)
      ;; :my/api
      ;; └── :my/cache
      ;;     └── :my/database

      ;; Later: stop (RECURSIVE - stops dependents first)
      (lifecycle/stop! :my/database)
      ;; → Stops: :my/api → :my/cache → :my/database

      ;; Surgical stop (only this module)
      (lifecycle/stop-only! :my/api)

      ;; Cleanup (RECURSIVE with reference checking)
      (lifecycle/cleanup! :my/api)
      ;; → Cleans :my/api
      ;; → Cleans :my/cache (if no other modules depend on it)
      ;; → Cleans :my/database (if no other modules depend on it)

  ## Relationship to patcho.patch

  Lifecycle management is complementary to version management:
  - patcho.patch: Version migrations (data/schema state transitions)
  - patcho.lifecycle: Runtime management (start/stop with dependencies)

  They work together:
  1. Apply patches to reach target version (patch/level!)
  2. Start runtime services (lifecycle/start!) - auto-runs setup if needed

  Note: start! automatically runs setup for modules that have a setup function,
  making the system easy to use while maintaining explicit control when needed.

  ## Design Decisions

  - Registry pattern: Modules stored in atom (like Patcho's patches)
  - Keyword topics: Same style as Patcho (:my/module)
  - Explicit dependencies: Clear, validated at runtime
  - RECURSIVE operations: start/setup/cleanup handle deps automatically
  - Auto-setup: start! runs setup if needed (idempotent via lifecycle store)
  - Reference counting: cleanup only removes if not claimed by others
  - State tracking: Prevents double-start bugs
  - Functions not protocols: Simple, direct
  - Minimal dependencies: Just clojure.core"
