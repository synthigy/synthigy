(ns patcho.patch
  "A simple version migration system for Clojure applications.
  
  Patcho provides a declarative way to define version-based patches that can be
  applied to migrate between different versions of your application or modules.
  
  Key features:
  - Automatic patch sequencing based on semantic versioning
  - Support for both upgrades and downgrades
  - Topic-based organization for modular systems
  - Simple macro-based API
  
  Basic usage:
    (require '[patcho.patch :as patch])
    
    ; Define current version
    (patch/current-version ::my-app \"2.0.0\")
    
    ; Define upgrade patches
    (patch/upgrade ::my-app \"1.0.0\"
      (println \"Initial setup\"))
    
    (patch/upgrade ::my-app \"2.0.0\"
      (println \"Major upgrade\"))
    
    ; Apply patches
    (patch/apply ::my-app \"1.0.0\")  ; Runs 2.0.0 upgrade
    (patch/apply ::my-app nil)        ; Runs all upgrades"
  (:refer-clojure :exclude [apply])
  (:require
    [version-clj.core :as vrs]))

  Useful for bootstrapping: start with AtomVersionStore, setup database,

  Args:
    from-store - Source VersionStore to read from
    to-store   - Destination VersionStore to write to
    topics     - Collection of topic keywords to migrate (or nil for all registered)

  Returns:

  Example:

(defn apply
  "Applies version patches to migrate from one version to another.

  With 1 arg:  Migrates from deployed-version to current-version.
  With 2 args: Migrates from 'current' to the topic's current version.
  With 3 args: Migrates from 'current' to 'target' version.

  The deployed-version is determined by the deployed-version multimethod,
  which defaults to reading from *version-store* but can be overridden
  via the installed-version macro.

  After successful migration, the new version is persisted to *version-store*.

  Arguments:
    topic   - Keyword identifying the module/component to patch
    current - Current version string (nil or \"0\" means start from beginning)
    target  - Target version string (optional, defaults to topic's current version)

  The function automatically:
    - Determines upgrade vs downgrade direction
    - Finds applicable patches between versions
    - Executes patches in correct order (oldest-first for upgrades, newest-first for downgrades)
    - Persists the new version to *version-store*

  Returns:
    The target version if patches were applied, nil otherwise

  Example:
    (apply ::my-app \"1.0.0\" \"2.0.0\")  ; Upgrade from 1.0.0 to 2.0.0
    (apply ::my-app \"2.0.0\" \"1.0.0\")  ; Downgrade from 2.0.0 to 1.0.0
